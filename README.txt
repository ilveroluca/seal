Seal
==================


Seal is a suite of distributed applications for aligning short DNA reads, and
manipulating and analyzing short read alignments.  Seal applications generally run on the Hadoop
framework and are made to scale well in the amount of computing nodes available
and the amount of the data to process.  This fact makes Seal particularly well
suited for processing large data sets.

See the documentation at http://biodoop-seal.sourceforge.net/ for more information.
